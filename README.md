# leaflet-challenge

## Background
The US Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in delivering scientific insights related to natural hazards, environmental and ecosystem health, as well as the effects of climate change and land use modifications. Their team of experts is dedicated to innovating new methodologies and tools to offer up-to-date, relevant, and actionable knowledge concerning the planet and how it operates.

## Prompt
The USGS is embarking on a project to develop innovative tools designed for the visualization of earthquake data. Despite gathering an extensive range of data globally on a daily basis, they find themselves challenged by the lack of an effective means to display this information. Your assignment involves devising a visualization solution for USGS's data to enhance public understanding and awareness, as well as to inform other governmental bodies, with the ultimate goal of securing additional funding to tackle global environmental challenges.

## Process
For this project, I utilized the Leaflet framework to construct a map that visually represents earthquake occurrences worldwide, pinpointing their locations based on longitude and latitude. The visualization differentiates earthquakes by magnitude and depthâ€”larger markers indicate more significant quakes, while color variations denote depth, with deeper earthquakes showcased in darker shades. Interactive popups offer detailed information on specific earthquakes upon clicking their markers. Moreover, I incorporated a legend to elucidate the map's data representation, aiding in the comprehensive understanding of the earthquake information displayed.
